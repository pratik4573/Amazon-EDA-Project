Release Year Patterns:

The number of titles added to Amazon Prime Video has significantly increased since the early 2000s, peaking around 2018-2020.

There was a noticeable drop in content added in 2021, which could be due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting production.

📝 Business Recommendations

Based on the insights gained from the analysis, here are some recommendations for Amazon Prime Video:

Diversify Content Genres:

While Drama and Comedy are the most popular genres, there is potential to expand into other genres like Crime, Thriller, and Sci-Fi to attract a broader audience.

Focus on High-Rated Content:

Titles with higher IMDb and TMDb ratings tend to be more popular. Investing in high-quality content with strong ratings can help retain and attract more subscribers.

Regional Content:

The United States is the leading producer of content on Amazon Prime Video. However, there is potential to expand into other regions, especially countries like India, which has a large audience base.

Shorter Runtime for TV Shows:

TV shows with shorter episode runtimes (around 40 minutes) are more popular. This could be a consideration for future content production.

Increase Content Production:

The drop in content added in 2021 could be a concern. Increasing the number of new titles added annually can help maintain subscriber interest and engagement.
